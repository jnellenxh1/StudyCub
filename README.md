# StudyCub
Our app, 'StudyCub', allows Secondary school students to make studying for their upcoming tests and examinations as easy as pie. With our vast variety of practice papers that ranges from every level and school, students will be able to study with ease. This app is perfect for last minute revision and even rewards students for completing practice papers with flying colours, making StudyCub the app for students.

## Design Process
We used a simple and clean, modern design so that the students are able to use the website. It is also interactive and is overall aesthetic but it is also useful. We use colours that complemented each other and colours that were easy on the eye so that it would not be so jarring. We decided the features by putting ourselves in a students shoes and figuring out what would be the most important parts of our website so that it would be accessible and usable for students.
